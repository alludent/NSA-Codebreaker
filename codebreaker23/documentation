New learned: 
task2: GPIO pins/functions
task3: docker, 

task1: provided corrdinates and timestamp of a unregistered signal captured by USCG
	- task: given database.db (NSA database), fnid ID's of similar signals
	* used: sqlite3 database.db
	* IDs: 74, 499

task2: USCG discovered the device transmitting the signal
	- given a pinout.svg of the device and an img of its CPU 
	- tasks: find the datasheet for the CPU and give pin numbers...
		- to power the GPIO header
			- a pin in the first 40
			- issues: 5V too much, r.Pi's use 3.3V?
			* a yellow pin
		- to ground the board
			- a pin in the first 40
			* any ground pin
		- for a UART transmit&receive 
			- a pin in the additioanl 20
			- issues: 36,37 incorrect
			* select from any consecutive GPIO numbers for the UART transmit/receive functions TXD1/RXD1

task3: the pins provided allowed communication with the device to create a filesystem dump
